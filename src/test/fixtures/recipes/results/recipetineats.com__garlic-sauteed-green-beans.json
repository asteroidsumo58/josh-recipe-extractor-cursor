  "title": "Sautéed Green Beans with Garlic",
  "description": "This is a wonderful,classic preparation for a green beans side dish - simmer beans until bright green then toss with garlic until golden and crispy. Serve as a side with everything, any cuisine, from Western to Italian, Middle Eastern to French!If serving with Asian food, I like to add the tiniest drizzle of sesame oil at the end and sometimes a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Just gives it that little Asian-esque finishing touch!Love green beans? So do I! See all my Green Bean Sides.",
