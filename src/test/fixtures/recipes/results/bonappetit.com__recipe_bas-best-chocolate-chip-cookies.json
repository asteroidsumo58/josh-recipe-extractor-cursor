Do Ahead: Dough balls can be portioned 3 months ahead; freeze on cookie sheets and then transfer to a resealable plastic bag. Bake from frozen, adding 1–2 minutes on to the cook time. Cookies can be baked 3 days ahead. Store in an airtight container at room temperature. Editor’s note: This recipe was originally published in April 2019.
