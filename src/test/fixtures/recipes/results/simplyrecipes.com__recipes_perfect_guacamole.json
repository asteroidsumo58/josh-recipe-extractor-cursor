The acid in the lime juice will provide some balance to the richness of the avocado and will help delay the avocados from turning brown. Add the chopped onion, cilantro, black pepper, and chilis. Chili peppers vary individually in their spiciness. So, start with a half of one chili pepper and add more to the guacamole to your desired degree of heat. Remember that much of this is done to taste because of the variability in the fresh ingredients. Start with this recipe and adjust to your taste.",

Serve with your choice of store-bought tortilla chips or make your own homemade tortilla chips . Refrigerate leftover guacamole up to 3 days. Note: Chilling tomatoes dulls their flavor. So, if you want to add chopped tomato to your guacamole, add just before serving. Did you love the recipe? Let us know with a rating and review!",
