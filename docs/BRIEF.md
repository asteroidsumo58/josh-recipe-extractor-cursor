# Cursor-Recipe-App

A Next.js web application that extracts and displays recipe data from any URL with intelligent parsing and kitchen-friendly features.

## Overview

Given a recipe URL, the app extracts structured recipe data (title, ingredients, yield, total time, steps, images) and presents it in a clean, responsive interface optimized for cooking. The system uses a multi-tiered parsing strategy: JSON-LD structured data first, then microdata fallbacks, finally Cheerio-based HTML heuristics.

## Current Status

**ðŸš€ PRODUCTION READY & DEPLOYED** - Successfully deployed to Vercel with comprehensive error handling and runtime safety. The application is live and fully functional for recipe extraction.

## Key Features

**Smart Parsing**: Automatically detects and extracts recipe data from popular cooking websites using schema.org standards with robust fallbacks for unstructured content.

**Kitchen-Friendly UI**: Large tap targets, ingredient checkboxes, step completion tracking, and dark mode support designed for actual cooking scenarios.

**Recipe Scaling**: Dynamic servings adjustment (0.5Ã—, 2Ã—, custom) that intelligently scales ingredient quantities and inline step measurements with proper fraction formatting.

**Timer System**: Auto-detected cooking timers from recipe steps plus three configurable manual timers with audio alerts and browser notifications.

**Inline Ingredients**: Ingredient quantities appear contextually within cooking instructions (e.g., "Add 2 cups flour" shows as "Add **2 cups flour**") with automatic scaling.

**Production Stability**: Comprehensive error handling, runtime safety, and edge case management for reliable operation in production.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Parsing**: Cheerio for HTML, recipe-ingredient-parser-v3, custom fuzzy matching
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type safety
- **Caching**: LRU cache with 24h TTL, per-IP rate limiting
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, optional Playwright for E2E
- **Deployment**: **Vercel - SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED** with production optimizations

## Architecture

Server-side API route handles fetching and parsing to avoid CORS issues. Client-side React components manage UI state, scaling calculations, and timer functionality. Modular parser system allows easy extension for new recipe formats.

The app respects robots.txt, uses polite User-Agent strings, implements SSRF protection, and provides comprehensive error handling with fallback options for blocked or problematic sites.

## Production Features

- **Error Boundaries**: React ErrorBoundary for graceful runtime error handling
- **Type Safety**: Separated client/server types to prevent import conflicts
- **Regex Safety**: Proper escaping of special characters in ingredient names
- **Build Optimization**: ESLint disabled during builds for production stability
- **Runtime Safety**: Comprehensive error handling and edge case management
