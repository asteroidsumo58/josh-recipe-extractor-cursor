# MVP Specification

## Core User Flow
1. User enters recipe URL in input field
2. System validates URL and fetches webpage content
3. Parser extracts recipe data using structured data or HTML heuristics
4. Recipe displays with interactive features (scaling, timers, checkboxes)
5. User can adjust servings, start timers, and track cooking progress

## Required Recipe Fields
- **Title**: Recipe name/heading
- **Ingredients**: List with original author units and wording preserved
- **Yield/Servings**: Number of portions the recipe makes
- **Total Time**: Complete cooking duration
- **Steps/Instructions**: Numbered cooking directions
- **Images**: At least one hero image when available

## Parsing Requirements
- **Primary**: JSON-LD structured data (schema.org/Recipe)
- **Secondary**: Microdata/RDFa markup
- **Fallback**: Cheerio HTML selectors with common patterns
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages
- **Logging**: Console output showing parse source, timing, and fallbacks

## UI/UX Behaviors

### Input & Loading
- Single URL input field with "Extract" button
- Loading spinner with parsing stage indicators
- Error messages with retry options and manual paste fallback
- **Theme toggle button in header for dark/light mode switching**

### Recipe Display
- Responsive layout (desktop + mobile)
- Hero image with Next.js optimization
- Recipe metadata cards (time, servings, etc.)
- Ingredient list with interactive checkboxes
- Step-by-step instructions with completion tracking
- **Theme toggle button in recipe view header**

### Scaling System
- Servings control with +/- buttons and quick presets
- Custom serving input (1-50 range)
- Real-time quantity updates in ingredients and steps
- Visual indicators when recipe is scaled
- Smart fraction formatting (1.5 → "1 1/2")

### Timer Features
- Auto-detected timers from step durations
- "Start timer" buttons next to relevant steps
- Inline step timers with circular countdown, Pause/Start, and Cancel controls
- Manual timers with custom labels managed in the left panel
- Audio alerts and browser notifications
- Visual progress bars and countdown displays

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Large touch targets for mobile use
- Focus management for interactive elements
- **Theme toggle accessibility with proper ARIA labels**

### Theme System
- **Dark mode as default theme for new users**
- **Smooth theme transitions with CSS animations**
- **Theme persistence via localStorage**
- **Comprehensive CSS custom properties for both themes**
- **Theme toggle component with sun/moon icons**
- **Hydration-safe theme application**

### Inline Ingredient Detection (Apr 2025)
- The ingredient matcher strips preparation tokens from ingredient names before building the fuzzy index
- Fuzzy threshold is 0.5 by default for step detection
- Replacement in steps prioritizes full "qty + unit + name" sequences, then falls back to name-only, then noun-tail plural variants
- Singular/plural heuristics cover common English endings (s/es/ies, o→oes)

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Server-side parsing to avoid CORS
- Image optimization via Next.js
- LRU cache with 24h TTL
- Rate limiting (10 requests/minute per IP)

### Error Handling
- Network timeout protection (30s)
- Invalid URL validation
- HTTP error responses (403, 404, etc.)
- Malformed HTML graceful handling
- SSRF protection against local addresses

### Data Validation
- Zod schemas for runtime type checking
- Sanitized HTML content rendering
- URL format validation
- Quantity parsing with error recovery

## Production Deployment

### Deployment Status
- **✅ SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED** to Vercel platform
- **✅ Production build optimization** completed
- **✅ Runtime error handling** implemented with ErrorBoundary
- **✅ Type safety** resolved for production builds
- **✅ Client-side import conflicts** resolved

### Production Features
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of runtime errors
- **Type Safety**: Separated client/server types to prevent conflicts
- **Regex Safety**: Proper escaping of special characters in ingredient names
- **Build Stability**: ESLint disabled during builds for production reliability
- **Runtime Safety**: Comprehensive error handling and edge case management
- **Theme System**: Dark/light mode toggle with persistence and smooth transitions
