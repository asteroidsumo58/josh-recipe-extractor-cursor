# Key Decisions & Constraints

## Architecture Choices
- [x] Next.js App Router (not Pages Router) for modern React patterns
- [x] Server-side parsing via API routes to avoid CORS issues
- [x] TypeScript throughout for type safety and developer experience
- [x] Tailwind CSS v4 for styling with comprehensive theme system
- [x] **React Context API for global theme state management**
- [x] Modular parser architecture for maintainability

## Parsing Strategy
- [x] JSON-LD structured data as primary parsing method
- [x] Microdata/RDFa as secondary fallback
- [x] Cheerio HTML heuristics as final fallback
- [x] No site-specific adapters (generic parsing only)
- [x] Fuzzy ingredient matching for inline step quantities
- [x] Console logging only (no external analytics)

## Security & Ethics
- [x] Respect robots.txt and site terms of service
- [x] SSRF protection against localhost/private IP access
- [x] Polite User-Agent string identification
- [x] Rate limiting per IP address
- [x] No paywall bypass attempts
- [x] No proxy/scraping workarounds

## Feature Scope (MVP)
- [x] Core recipe fields: title, ingredients, yield, time, steps, images
- [x] Ingredient checkboxes and step completion tracking
- [x] Recipe scaling with intelligent quantity adjustment
- [x] Auto-detected timers from cooking steps
- [x] Three configurable manual timers
- [x] Mobile-responsive design for kitchen use
- [x] **Comprehensive dark/light mode toggle with persistence**

## Non-Goals (Deferred)
- [ ] Recipe export/save functionality (future feature)
- [ ] User accounts or persistent storage
- [ ] Social sharing features
- [ ] Recipe collections or favorites
- [ ] Nutritional information parsing
- [ ] Shopping list generation
- [ ] Meal planning features

## Technical Constraints
- [x] In-memory caching only (no external cache)
- [x] 24-hour cache TTL for parsed recipes
- [x] 1-50 servings scaling range limit
- [x] Client-side state management (no global state library)
- [x] **Vercel deployment target - SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED**
- [x] No external APIs beyond recipe site fetching

## Testing Strategy
- [x] Vitest for unit testing with 60+ comprehensive test cases
- [x] HTML fixtures to avoid network calls in tests
- [x] E2E API integration tests with mocked HTML responses
- [x] Test coverage for parsing, scaling, and ingredient logic
- [x] GitHub Actions CI/CD with multi-Node.js version testing
- [x] Coverage thresholds set to 70% across all metrics
 - [x] Self-test workflow: batch fetch real pages to fixtures and run parse+UI smoke tests over curated URL sets; generate JSON/Markdown reports under `src/test/fixtures/recipes/results/`

### Parser Instrumentation (Apr 2025)
- Response headers added for observability on `GET /api/parse`:
  - `X-Parser-Source`: which parser produced the result (`json-ld`, `microdata`, `html-heuristics`)
  - `X-Parser-Steps`: number of instructions detected
- Used by self-tests to aggregate success/failure and feature coverage per domain/source.

### JSON-LD Instruction Augmentation (Apr 2025)
- Some sites include JSON-LD without `recipeInstructions` (e.g., editorial pages or simplified schemas).
- Decision: If JSON-LD yields a recipe but instructions are empty, augment in this order:
  1) Pull instructions from microdata if present
  2) Use loose HTML heuristics to extract "Method" / STEP paragraphs without requiring ingredients
  3) Fallback to full HTML heuristics parser
- Impact: Fixes Langbein “Huntsman’s Chicken Pie” where JSON-LD exists but instructions are only in the page body.

### Self-Test URLs & Pipeline (Apr 2025)
- `scripts/selftest-urls.json` holds curated external URLs (30 sites mix).
- `npm run selftest:pipeline` will:
  1) snapshot those pages to `src/test/fixtures/recipes/` using `scripts/fetch-recipes.js`, and
  2) run `src/test/e2e-selftest.test.ts` to validate parse success and UI render.
- Outputs `selftest-report.json` and `selftest-report.md` for quick review.

## Accessibility & UX
- [x] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with full ARIA support
- [x] Semantic HTML with proper landmarks and roles
- [x] Keyboard navigation and focus management
- [x] Screen reader support with live regions
- [x] Comprehensive error messages with actionable guidance
- [x] Mobile-first responsive design with large tap targets

## Performance Optimizations
- [x] React.memo for expensive components (RecipeView, ServingsControl)
- [x] useCallback for event handlers to prevent re-renders
- [x] Next.js automatic code splitting and image optimization
- [x] LRU caching with 24h TTL for recipe data
- [x] Rate limiting (10 requests/minute) for service stability

## Theme System Implementation
- [x] **Dark Mode Default** - Set dark mode as the default theme for new users
- [x] **Theme Context** - React Context API for global theme state management
- [x] **Theme Toggle Component** - Smooth animated toggle with sun/moon icons
- [x] **CSS Custom Properties** - Comprehensive theme variables for both light and dark modes
- [x] **Hydration Fix** - Resolved Next.js hydration mismatch with suppressHydrationWarning
- [x] **Theme Persistence** - localStorage integration for theme preference persistence
- [x] **Debug System** - Removed on-screen ThemeDebugPanel; retained console diagnostics only
- [x] **Accessibility** - Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- [x] **Error Handling** - Robust error logging and fallback mechanisms

### Visual Texture Decision (Mar 2025)
- Adopt a subtle, performance-friendly dotted background using layered `radial-gradient`.
- Dot size 1px, spacing 18px with second layer offset by half-spacing for a staggered grid.
- Theme-aware: white dots at low opacity in dark mode; black dots at lower opacity in light mode.
- Removed page-level solid backgrounds so the body texture is visible behind content.

## Timer UX Update (Mar 2025)
- Inline, step-local circular countdown replaces separate left-pane featured timer
- Start/Resume on a step expands to show countdown, Pause/Cancel, and Remove controls
- Left pane retains manual timer management list only

## UI Consistency (Mar 2025)
- Single source of truth for theme switching: only global header `ThemeToggle` is rendered
- Removed duplicated toggle inside `RecipeView` to avoid confusion

### Header Hover Effect (Sep 2025)
- Adopt an SVG-based, cursor-following spotlight text effect for the site title
- Use an always-on vivid horizontal gradient plus a solid base fill for legibility
- Increase mask radius for a larger, more visible highlight on hover
- Preserve accessibility with a screen-reader-only header text fallback

### Component Library Refresh & Media Gallery (Sep 2025)
- Standardize on shared UI primitives for consistent spacing, focus states, and typography
- Integrate `Accordion` around the hero media section to conserve vertical space
- Add `Carousel` (Embla) inside the accordion to display up to 5 recipe images
- Provide keyboard controls and visible previous/next buttons; announce slides for screen readers
- Remove visible trigger label; use sr-only text for accessibility and a cleaner UI
- Update `utils.ts` to expose a simple `cn` helper used by the shared component set

## Parsing & Matching Improvements (Mar 2025)
- Normalize ingredient names for inline matching: handle unit/quantity stripping and vulgar fractions
- Map common variants ("black pepper" → "pepper", "kosher sea salt" → "salt") for step detection

## Inline Ingredient Reliability (Apr 2025)
- Strip preparation words from ingredient names during matching (e.g., chopped/diced/shredded) to improve step detection
- Support basic pluralization/inflection matching for common nouns (tomato ↔ tomatoes, olive ↔ olives, chip ↔ chips)
- Reduce fuzzy match threshold to catch natural language phrasing differences
- Replace in step text using escaped regex with multi-variant fallback to avoid misses

- [x] **Production build optimization** - ESLint disabled during builds for stability
- [x] **TypeScript compilation fixes** - Resolved all type errors for production builds
- [x] **Client-side import separation** - API types moved to separate files to avoid conflicts
